<h3>Time complexity:</h3>
 <p>Generally, a program that solely uses a nested if-else statement will likely have a lower time complexity compared to a program utilizing an API call, as API calls usually involve network communication which can introduce additional processing time, making the API call potentially less efficient than a simple nested conditional check. </p>
 Key points to consider: 
  <h4>API overhead:</h4>
   <p>Making an API request often involves network latency, data serialization, and server processing, which can significantly impact execution time compared to simple conditional logic within a program.</p>
  <h4>Constant time complexity:</h4>
   <p>In most cases, a nested if-else statement, regardless of the number of conditions, still has a time complexity of O(1) because only one branch of the conditions will be executed at a time. </p>
